***This project is an open-source endeavor released under the permissive MIT License.***

**This tool allows you to:**
- adjust
  - the dice start - you can decide if the dice starts with a 0 or 1 on the first side
  - the seed of the dice
  - how many sides the die has
  - how many dice are going to rolled at once
  - a factor multiplied on every rolled die within one roll
  - the result's scale (by multiplying the result with the inputted value)
  - an additive modifier for the dice (You can add negative numbers)
  - the operation made (e.g. add all dice, substract the second from the first, etc.)
  - apply advantage or disadvantage on rolls
- view
  - the chances per side (in %)
  - the result of the roll (no decimal places)
  - the scaled result of the roll (3 decimal places)
  - the modified result of the roll (3 decimal places)
  - all the adjustable settings

The tool's window is held as small as possible, so it is no obstacle on the screen.
This tool's display sub-project is made for Windows only and was tested on Windows 10 only.
